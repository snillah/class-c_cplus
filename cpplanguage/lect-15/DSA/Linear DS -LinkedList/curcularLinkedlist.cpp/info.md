1. What is a Circular Linked List?

A circular linked list is just like a normal linked list, but the last node points back to the first node instead of NULL.

That means:

In singly circular linked list → last->next = head

In doubly circular linked list → last->next = head and head->prev = last

This makes it easy to loop through all elements in a cycle without restarting from the head.


3. Key Differences from Normal Linked List
Normal Linked List	Circular Linked List
Last node points to NULL	Last node points to the first node
Traversal stops at NULL	Traversal can loop infinitely if not careful
Used for linear data	Used for circular tasks like buffering, playlists, round-robin scheduling

4. Real-life Uses
Round robin scheduling (OS process scheduling)

Circular buffers (music playlists, continuous queues)

Game logic (players taking turns in a cycle)
