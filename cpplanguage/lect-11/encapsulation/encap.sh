Encapsulation in C++

Encapsulation is an OOP principle where data (variables) and
functions (methods) are bundled together inside a class, while restricting direct access to the internal data.

This is done using access specifiers (private, protected, public) to control how data is accessed or modified.


Key Features of Encapsulation
Data Hiding → Internal details are hidden from the outside world.

Controlled Access → Data is accessed or modified through getter/setter methods.

Improves Security → Prevents unauthorized or accidental changes.

Improves Maintainability → Changes to internal implementation don’t affect external code.
