// Hierarchical inheritance occurs when multiple classes inherit from a single base class.

// This allows different derived classes to share common properties or methods from one parent class while also having their own unique features.


// Hierarchical = one base → many derived

// Multilevel = chain (A → B → C)

// Multiple = one derived inherits from multiple bases

// Hybrid = combination of two or more types

// Would you like me to create a diagram showing all types of inheritance (single, multiple, multilevel, hierarchical, hybrid) in one visual for easy comparison?
