When you say connectivity in C++, 
it usually refers to connecting your C++ application with external systems, 
most commonly:

1. Database Connectivity (MySQL / SQLite / PostgreSQL)
You can connect your C++ application to a database to store, read, and manage data

2. File Connectivity
Used for storing and retrieving data from files (like text or CSV).

3. Network Connectivity
For connecting to servers / APIs / sockets:

Sockets → For TCP/UDP connections

HTTP Libraries (libcurl) → For making web requests

Summary:

Database connectivity → Use MySQL Connector or ODBC

File connectivity → Use <fstream>

Network connectivity → Use sockets or libcurl


Install libcurl

Windows (MinGW or MSVC)

Download cURL for Windows

Extract and add the include and lib directories to your compiler settings.

When compiling:

g++ main.cpp -o main -I"path_to_curl\include" -L"path_to_curl\lib" -lcurl

Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libcurl4-openssl-dev
compile: 
g++ main.cpp -o main -lcurl


macOS

brew install curl
compile :
g++ main.cpp -o main -I/opt/homebrew/opt/curl/include -L/opt/homebrew/opt/curl/lib -lcurl


Verify Installation:
curl-config --version

3. Alternative: Avoid libcurl
If you just need basic networking, you can:

Use Boost.Asio for TCP/HTTP.

Or run system("curl <url>") as a quick hack (not recommended for production).
