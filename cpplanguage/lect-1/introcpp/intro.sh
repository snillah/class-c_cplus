What is C++?
C++ is an extension of the C programming language, developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in the early 1980s at Bell Labs. 

C++ was created to include Object-Oriented Programming features and to provide a higher level of abstraction. 

This enables developers to create complex applications with more ease and manageability.  


A. Developer of the Language 

C was developed by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. 
Ritchie aimed to create a language that combined the power of assembly language with the simplicity of high-level languages, 
leading to the creation of C. His work laid the foundation for many subsequent programming languages. 

C++ was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs. 
Stroustrup sought to enhance the C language by adding Object-Oriented features,
 which led to the creation of C++. 
 His goal was to provide a language that offered both 
 high-level abstraction 
 and 
 low-level control, 
 bridging the gap between efficient system programming and complex application development. 

 B.Security 

 C does not provide built-in support for data encapsulation, 
 making it less secure regarding data hiding and protection. 
 
 In C, all data is accessible and modifiable from any part of the program,
  which can lead to unintentional modifications and security vulnerabilities. 

C++ supports data encapsulation through classes and access specifiers (private, protected, and public), 
enhancing security by protecting data from unauthorised access. This encapsulation ensures that data can only be accessed and modified through defined interfaces, 
promoting better data integrity and security. 

C. Programming Paradigm 
C follows a procedural programming paradigm, 
focusing on functions and sequences of commands. 
The emphasis is on the steps to be performed, and the program is structured around functions that carry out these steps. 

C++ follows an Object-Oriented Programming paradigm, emphasising objects, classes, and inheritance. 
It also supports procedural programming. 
This dual paradigm allows for greater flexibility in designing software, 
enabling the use of objects to model real-world entities and relationships, while also supporting procedural programming for simpler tasks. 

D .Keywords 
C has 32 keywords, including int, return, for, while, if, else, and switch. These keywords form the core syntax of the language, providing the basic constructs for defining variables, controlling flow, and performing operations. 

C++ has 63 keywords, including all C keywords and additional ones like class, public, private, namespace, template, and virtual. These additional keywords support the Object-Oriented features and other enhancements introduced in C++, expanding the language's capabilities and flexibility. For those transitioning or comparing C++ with C#, a C Sharp Cheat Sheet can be a useful tool to understand how similar concepts and keywords are implemented in C#. 


8) Data Types 
C supports basic data types such as int, float, char, and double. These fundamental data types are used to define variables and structures in C, providing the basic building blocks for data manipulation. 

C++ supports all C data types and introduces additional data types like bool, wchar_t, and user-defined types like class and Enum. These additional types enable more expressive and flexible data definitions, supporting advanced programming concepts like Object-Oriented design and type safety. 

9) File Extension 
C source files use the .c file extension. This extension indicates that the file contains C source code, which is compiled using a C compiler. 

C++ source files use the .cpp, .cc, or .cxx file extensions. These extensions indicate that the file contains C++ source code, which is compiled using a C++ compiler. The different extensions reflect historical and stylistic preferences in different development environments.
